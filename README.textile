h1. Welcome

OpenOverflow is an open source Question and Answer application that is
inspired by "stackoverflow.com":http://www.stackoverflow.com. 


h1. Prerequisites

You need PostgreSQL, and the ruby-pg gem.

  sudo gem install ruby-pg


OpenOverflow works for me on Mac OS X, with Rails 2.3.2.


h1. Configuration

h2. Internationalization

You can set your own locale in config/initializers/locale.rb. So far,
there are English, Spanish (Argentina), and German versions available.
Locale files are in config/locales. 

Note: internationalization is not yet finished.

h2. Site name etc.

A few configurations can be made in config/config.yml.
